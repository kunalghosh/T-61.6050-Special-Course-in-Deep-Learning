## Exercise 4 (Regularization)
The aim of this exercise is to extend the MNIST classifier written in exercise 3 to include regularization. 
I have tested with **L2 weight decay** and **additive Gaussian noise** injected in the inputs. 
A suitable regularization strength was chosen using a held-out **validation** set.
