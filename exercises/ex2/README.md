## Exercise 2 (Logistic Regression Gradient Descent)

In this exercise we implement logistic regression trained with gradient descent in Theano. We experiment with using a small
constant learning rate. Also we *Plot training criterion (negative Log Likelihood) as a function of iteration k*.

We ignore Test and Validation Errors for the time being. (We start evaluating them from exercise 4 onwards).
